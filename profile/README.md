We are a computational modelling group of the institute of condensed matter physics and material physics (ICMP) in the school of physics at Peking University. We develop and apply state of the art computational methods to study the electronic structure, atomic structure and dynamics or materials and condensed matter systems. We are particularly interested in surfaces, interfaces and low-dimensional systems. We often work closely with other theoretical and experimental research groups across the world.
